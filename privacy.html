    <h1>Privacy Policy for YouTube Loop Extension</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 12, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Thank you for using the YouTube Loop browser extension ("the Extension"). This privacy policy explains how we handle information when you use the Extension. Our goal is transparency and respecting your privacy. The Extension's sole purpose is to allow you to select a start and end time for a YouTube video and play that specific section in a loop.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Handle</h2>
    <p>
        The Extension needs to handle minimal information solely to perform its function:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Provided Loop Times:</strong> The start and end times (in seconds) that you input into the extension's popup interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Video Playback Time:</strong> The extension interacts with the YouTube video player on the active YouTube page to read the current playback time and to set the playback time (seek) according to the loop times you provide.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The Extension **does not** collect, store, or transmit any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as your name, email address, location, or user accounts.
    </p>
     <p>
        The Extension **does not** track your Browse history or activity on websites other than interacting with the video player on the YouTube page (`youtube.com`) where you actively use the extension.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>
        The information handled is used exclusively within your browser for the following purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>To receive the start and end points for the video loop from you via the popup.</li>
        <li>To read the YouTube video's current time to check if it has reached the loop's end point.</li>
        <li>To set the YouTube video's current time back to the loop's start point when the end point is reached.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All processing happens locally within your browser on the active YouTube page.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        To provide a more convenient user experience, the Extension may store the last used start and end loop times locally within your browser's storage mechanism (specifically, using the <code>chrome.storage</code> API). This allows the extension to remember your previous settings the next time you use the popup. This data is stored only on your device (or synced via your browser profile if using <code>chrome.storage.sync</code>) and is not accessed by the developer.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Transmission</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>We do not share, sell, or transmit any data handled by the Extension to the developer or any third parties.</strong> All functionality and data handling occur locally within your web browser. The loop times and interaction with the video player are not sent anywhere outside of your computer.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
         Since all data handling is performed locally within your browser and no data is transmitted, the security relies on the security measures of your own browser and computer system. We have designed the extension to use the minimum necessary permissions and data handling required for its function.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any changes. Updates will be reflected by the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy.
    </p>
